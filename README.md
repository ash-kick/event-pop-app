1. What tech stack will you use for your final project?

-    React Native: For developing a cross-platform mobile application that runs on
     iOS and Android using a single codebase.
-    React: For building the web application, ensuring a consistent and interactive
     user experience across platforms.

2. Is the front-end UI or the back-end going to be the focus of your project? Or are
   you going to make an evenly focused full-stack application?

     - Evenly focused full stack.

3. Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?

-    A website and mobile app.

4. What goal will your project be designed to achieve?

-    It will be designed to be an app that people can use to help find and plan fun events/activities.

5. What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of
   your users?

-    Anyone looking to find events in their area or an area of interest.

6. What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data?
   You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind
   of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and
   populate it with data.

-    I plan to use data from ticket master's api.

7. What does your database schema look like?

- 

     - What kinds of issues might you run into with your API? This is especially important
       if you are creating your own API, web scraping produces notoriously messy data.
     - Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?
     - What functionality will your app include?
     - What will the user flow look like?
     - What features make your site more than a CRUD app? What are your stretch
       goals?
